# Applying the Social View of Learning in Team Meetings

*A 30-minute introductory training module for InnovateCorp managers*

---

## Introduction

Lieberman's social view of learning posits that learning is fundamentally a social process, occurring through interaction, dialogue, and collaboration with others. This perspective challenges the traditional notion of learning as an individual, internal activity and instead emphasizes that knowledge is co-constructed in social contexts. For InnovateCorp managers, this means that team meetings are not just forums for information sharing but powerful opportunities for collective learning. By intentionally designing meetings to foster open dialogue, active listening, and reciprocal feedback, managers can transform routine gatherings into dynamic learning experiences that enhance team performance, innovation, and cohesion.
